## 🌞 The Purpose

* **Easy canvas drawing** with high-level helpers 
* **Smart creation of controls** by compositing different components
* **Custom layout system** to create, layout and render your drawn controls with gestures and animations
* **Hardware-accelerated** rendering on iOS • MacCatalyst • Android • Windows
* **Free to use** under the MIT license, stable NuGet package available
* **Hybrid approach**: Use inside existing MAUI apps by wrapping drawn controls in `Canvas` views
* **Fully drawn apps**: Create totally drawn apps with just one Canvas as root view 
* **Virtual controls**: No native views/handlers created, UI-thread not required for access
* **To have the tools to create and use your own controls** to expand the limits of the predefined

## 🤔 Onboarding

**Q: What is the difference between DrawnUi and other drawn frameworks?**  
A: Not really comparable since DrawnUI is just a library for **.NET MAUI**, to let you draw UI instead of using native views.

**Q: Why choose drawn over native UI?**  
A: Rather a freedom choice to draw what you want and how you see it.  
It also can bemore performant to draw a complex UI on just one canvas instead of composing it with many native views.

**Q: Do I need to know how to draw on a canvas??**  
A: No, you can start by using prebuilt drawn controls and customize them. All controls are initially designed to be subclassed, customized, and almost every method is virtual. 

**Q: Can I still use XAML?**  
A: Yes you can use both XAML and code-behind to create your UI.  

**Q: Can I avoid using XAML at all costs?**  
A: Yes feel free to use code-behind to create your UI, up to using background thread to access and modify drawn controls properties.

**Q: How do I create custom controls with DrawnUI?**  
A: Inherit from `SkiaControl` for basic controls or `SkiaLayout` for containers etc. Override the `Paint` method to draw with SkiaSharp.

**Q: Can I embed native MAUI controls inside DrawnUI?**  
A: Yes! Use `SkiaMauiElement` to embed native MAUI controls like WebView inside your DrawnUI canvas. This allows you to combine the best of both worlds.

**Q: Possible to create a game with DrawnUI?**  
A: Well, since you draw, why not just draw a game instead of a business app. DrawnUI comes with gaming helpers and custom accelerated platform views to assure a smooth display-synched rendering.
