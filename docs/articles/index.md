## ðŸŽ¯ Purpose

* Provides infrastructure to create and render drawn controls with gestures and animations, comes with some pre-built controls.
* Profits from hardware-accelerated rendering on iOS â€¢ MacCatalyst â€¢ Android â€¢ Windows
* Free to use under the MIT license, a nuget package is available.
* To consume inside a usual MAUI app - wrap drawn controls inside `Canvas` views.
* To create a totally drawn apps with just one `Canvas` as root view - `SkiaShell`, `SkiaViewSwitcher` are provided for navigation with modals, popups, toasts etc.

**Drawn controls are virtual: no native views/handlers created, UI-thread is not required to accessed and modify them.**

## âš¡ Features

* __Create your own animated pixel-perfect controls__

## ðŸ¤” Onboarding

**Q: What is the difference between DrawnUi and other drawn frameworks?**  
A: Not really comparable since DrawnUI is just a library for **.NET MAUI**, to let you draw UI instead of using native views.

**Q: Why choose drawn over native UI?**  
A: Rather a freedom choice to draw what you want and how you see it.  
It also can bemore performant to draw a complex UI on just one canvas instead of composing it with many native views.

**Q: Do I need to know how to draw on a canvas??**  
A: No, you can start by using prebuilt drawn controls and customize them. All controls are initially designed to be subclassed, customized, and almost every method is virtual. 

**Q: Can I still use XAML?**  
A: Yes you can use both XAML and code-behind to create your UI.  

**Q: Can I avoid using XAML at all costs?**  
A: Yes feel free to use code-behind to create your UI, up to using background thread to access and modify drawn controls properties.

**Q: How do I create custom controls with DrawnUI?**  
A: Inherit from `SkiaControl` for basic controls or `SkiaLayout` for containers etc. Override the `Paint` method to draw with SkiaSharp.

**Q: Can I embed native MAUI controls inside DrawnUI?**  
A: Yes! Use `SkiaMauiElement` to embed native MAUI controls like WebView inside your DrawnUI canvas. This allows you to combine the best of both worlds.

**Q: Possible to create a game with DrawnUI?**  
A: Well, since you draw, why not just draw a game instead of a business app. DrawnUI comes with gaming helpers and custom accelerated platform views to assure a smooth display-synched rendering.
